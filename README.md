# hassio_mqtt_ir_blaster
This Project should replace some of your current ir remotes.

I've replaced 2 remotes(Lg TV & Harman/Kardon AVR 300 RDS.

The code is very specific for my use case but could be modified to fit your Needs.

I've added the mqtt commands to hassio and created buttons to control it via App. The code for Home assistant is in the Hassio.yaml

Please dm me if you have any questions/suggestions for improvements or if you find any bugs!

Hope you like the program as much as I've enjoyed creating it!

Many thanks,
